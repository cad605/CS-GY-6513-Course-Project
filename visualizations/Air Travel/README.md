# Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on US Domestic Air Travel
This application is a collection of maps, line charts, change charts, and slope graphs that help to visualize the huge amount of data that was processed for this project. We began with well over 11 GB of flight data for dates between January 1, 2019 to March 31, 2021. We processed this data into smaller, separate outputs such that we can load them in the browser, and display interactive and looped visualizations. Each visual comes with some commentary pointing out interesting information that can be gleaned from that particular visualization.
