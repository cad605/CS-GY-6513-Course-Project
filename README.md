## Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on the US Domestic Tourism and Hospitality Industry
COVID-19 has caused unprecedented damage to the global tourism industry, which "made up 10 percent of global GDP in 2019 and was worth almost \$9 trillion, making the sector nearly three times larger than agriculture" (McKinsey, 0820). In this project, we assess the damage done to the US domestic tourism and hospitality industry. We plan on conducting this analysis by taking the pulse of three main economic sub-sectors: commercial air travel, hotels, and restaurants.

## Data
All data for this project can be accessed at this drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ur5P0akkruziielMMrjqS6-3tZHUASjZ?usp=sharing

### Original Sources
1) Flight data was provided by the Open Sky Network at https://opensky-network.org/
2) Airport location data was provided by OurAirports at https://ourairports.com/data/

## Code
The code for this project is in two main folders: `data wrangling` and `visualizations`. Each folder then has a subfolder for the analysis conducted for a particular economic sub-sector. For example, a Jupyter Notebook script for combining seperate csv files, as well as PySpark scripts for integrating and analyzing US Domestic Air Travel data, can be found in `data wrangling/Air Travel`.

## Visualizations
