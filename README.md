# Assessing the Impact of COVID-19 on the US Domestic Tourism and Hospitality Industry
COVID-19 has caused unprecedented damage to the global tourism industry, which "made up 10 percent of global GDP in 2019 and was worth almost \$9 trillion, making the sector nearly three times larger than agriculture" (McKinsey, 0820). In this project, we assess the damage done to the US domestic tourism and hospitality industry. We plan on conducting this analysis by taking the pulse of three main economic sub-sectors: commercial air travel, hotels, and restaurants.
